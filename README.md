**Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Fellipeâ€”a Curious Data Scientist with a Story to Tell**

Curiosity has always been my compass. From uncovering truths as a journalist to extracting insights from complex datasets, I thrive on turning questions into actionable answers. My journey began with storytelling, which evolved into a fascination for dataâ€”a medium that reveals patterns, truths, and untold stories waiting to be discovered.

Graduating in journalism taught me to think critically, spot bias, and ask the right questions. Transitioning into data science, I brought this investigative mindset to my work, where I donâ€™t just analyze numbersâ€”I interview the data, seeking the narrative behind the patterns. I believe data is the start of the story, and digging deeper uncovers its full potential.

In my professional experience as a General Manager in the hospitality industry, Iâ€™ve managed teams, optimized finances, and collaborated across departments to navigate challenges. Leveraging a multi-perspective approach has been key to implementing data-driven solutions and fostering effective decision-making.

**Hereâ€™s What Iâ€™ve Been Up To:**

* Data Science Bootcamp: I became well versed on Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn; worked with tools like Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code; and built machine learning models that actually deliver results.

* Real-World Experience: From managing people to tailoring finances, Iâ€™ve learned how to take data insights and make them work in real life.

* Big Picture Thinking: Whether itâ€™s finding patterns in a dataset or solving a business problem, I always approach challenges with curiosity, creativity, and a willingness to learn.

Letâ€™s build something amazingâ€”one dataset, one story at a time.
