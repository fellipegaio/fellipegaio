Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Fellipe, a Data Scientist with a Storytelling Edge
Curiosity has always been my compass. From uncovering truths as a journalist to extracting insights from complex datasets, I thrive on turning questions into actionable answers. My journey began with storytelling, which evolved into a fascination for dataâ€”a medium that reveals patterns, truths, and untold stories waiting to be discovered.

Graduating in journalism taught me to think critically, spot bias, and ask the right questions. Transitioning into data science, I brought this investigative mindset to my work, where I donâ€™t just analyze numbersâ€”I interview the data, seeking the narrative behind the patterns. I believe data is the start of the story, and digging deeper uncovers its full potential.

In my professional experience as a General Manager in the hospitality industry, Iâ€™ve managed teams, optimized finances, and collaborated across departments to navigate challenges. Leveraging a multi-perspective approach has been key to implementing data-driven solutions and fostering effective decision-making.

What I Bring to the Table:
Technical Skills: Proficient in Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn), and tools like Jupyter Notebook and Visual Studio Code.
Project Expertise: Hands-on experience building predictive models, conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and developing machine learning projects that deliver actionable insights.
Leadership: Years of experience in team management, bridging gaps between technical and operational teams, and driving projects with clear communication and purpose.
Perspective: A journalistâ€™s eye for detail, a data scientistâ€™s analytical rigor, and a leaderâ€™s ability to bring it all together.
Whether Iâ€™m creating machine learning models or managing business operations, I approach every challenge with curiosity and a commitment to uncovering the full story.
